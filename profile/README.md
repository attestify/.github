# Hey There ðŸ‘‹

Attestify integrates information for industry-wide and private software supply chains.  The outcome is an explicit methodology to declare what is trustable. It has two ambitions:

1. Be the system that establishes a nexus of trust for the open source ecosystem
1. Automate the software governance processes for software supply chain management.

The domain and kernel specifications describe the interfaces and use cases for the components of Attestify. The kernel consists of reusable components used by multiple aspects of the project. The domain is the aggregate set of use cases the software implements.

| Specification | Project Board |
|---------------|---------------|
|<a href="https://attestify.github.io/kernel-specification" target="_blank">Kernel</a> | <a href="https://github.com/orgs/attestify/projects/2" target="_blank">Kernel Backlog</a>  |
| <a href="https://attestify.github.io/domain-specification" target="_blank">Domain</a> | <a href="https://github.com/orgs/attestify/projects/1" target="_blank">Domain Backlog</a> |

The specs are not specific to a programming language. The specification's purpose is to describe the structure and behavioral expectations of the system and components. The specifications are not code-specific documentation. Each repository will have its documentation of how that repository implements the Attestify specification.
